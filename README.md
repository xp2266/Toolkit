# Utility Toolkit

This repository consists of a set of utility scripts for various tasks. These tools are implemented in Python and can be used directly from the command line.

The toolkit currently includes the following utilities:

* `rename_files.py`: A script to rename files in a specified directory based on a given regular expression pattern. The new file names will be generated by replacing the matched text with a given replacement text.

We plan to continue adding new tools to this repository in the future.

## Usage

Each tool in this repository is a standalone Python script. To use a tool, you need to have Python installed on your system.

For instructions on how to use each individual tool, please see the corresponding section of the README file in the tool's directory.
